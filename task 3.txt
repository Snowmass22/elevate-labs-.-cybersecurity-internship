i have used nmap for scaning my system's vulnerability cause it is easy with nmap


Vulnerability Scan Findings (Nmap with vuln script)
The scan focused on 192.168.1.2 and found several open ports and ran vulnerability scripts against them. Here are the key findings from the nmap -sV --script=vuln command:

1. Open Ports and Services
The scan identified the following services running on your PC:

Port/Protocol	State	Service	Version/Description
80/tcp	open	http	Microsoft IIS HTTPD 10.0 (Microsoft IIS/10.0)
135/tcp	open	msrpc	Microsoft Windows RPC
139/tcp	open	netbios-ssn	Microsoft Windows netbios-ssn
445/tcp	open	microsoft-ds	Microsoft Windows netbios-ssn
4343/tcp	open	ssl/unicali?	(Unknown service over SSL)
4449/tcp	open	ssl/privatewire?	(Unknown service over SSL)

2. Specific Vulnerability Script Results
The Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) scripts from the vuln category found the following (Note: The scripts listed check for specific, well-known vulnerabilities, but their results often need manual confirmation):

Finding	Status	Severity	Mitigation/Action
HTTP Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Checks	Not Found	Low	Scripts http-dombased-xss and http-stored-xss did not find these specific vulnerabilities.
HTTP Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Checks	Not Found	Low	Script http-csrf couldn't find any CSRF vulnerabilities.
smb-vuln-ms10-054	false	Medium	The script reported false, indicating the system is likely NOT vulnerable to this specific Samba/SMB vulnerability.
smb-vuln-cve-2012-1182	ERROR	High/Critical	The script reported an ERROR ("Could not negotiate a connection"). This means the script failed to complete the check, so the vulnerability status is unknown. This needs manual investigation.
smb-vuln-ms10-061	ERROR	High/Critical	The script reported an ERROR ("Could not negotiate a connection"). The vulnerability status is unknown. This needs manual investigation.

3. Most Critical Potential Issue
The most significant finding is that Microsoft IIS HTTPD 10.0 is running on port 80. While the Nmap script did not confirm any specific web application vulnerabilities, running a web server on your local machine means the server itself, and any websites hosted on it, should be kept fully patched and securely configured.

The errors on the SMB vulnerability checks for ports 139/445 are also critical, as these are common vectors for network attacks. The errors suggest the Nmap scripts were blocked or failed to communicate correctly.
