The network traffic capture was conducted on the Wi-Fi interface for 60 seconds. The traffic was generated by pinging google.com and browsing a news website.

Four distinct protocols were identified through filtering:

ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol): Captured during the ping operation, showing the successful exchange of Echo Request and Echo Reply packets between my host and the destination server.

DNS (Domain Name System): Captured when the browser resolved the IP address for the website, showing a standard query and the corresponding IP address response.

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol): Found numerous TCP packets, specifically the three-way handshake (SYN, SYN/ACK, ACK) used to reliably establish the connection before web data transfer.

TLS/SSL (Transport Layer Security): Dominated the web browsing traffic, confirming that the site was accessed securely via HTTPS, with the data payload being encrypted and unreadable without the encryption key
